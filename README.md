# PyramidPanicContributions
This repository showcases my contributions to a group project Pyramid Panic, previously known as Tombers and Pyramiders. Pyramid Panic was a group project for the final semester of the BTech games development program at BCIT (January - April 2018). We used a C++ game engine that we made from scratch. My role for this project was to create the audio system and assets, as well as collaborating on the networking system. My friend Jaegar set up most of the networking manager and components, while I had a focus on setting up the UDP functionalities of our system. We also did pair programming throughout the project which really sped up bug fixes and testing. Check out my experience on this project here https://kevingregoryhan.com/pyramidpanic
